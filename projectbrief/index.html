        <h2>project brief</h2>
        <p>For the final, I want to work on the Every Picture Project and I mainly want to clean up the code and details such as the hovering effects and work on more accessibility elements.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item2">
        <h2>project goals</h2>
        <p>My code for the every picture project wasn’t flexible and I hard coded numbers but for the final I want to make it more responsive and flexible. For instance, the scroll for the carousel of images was assigned numbers and would only work in that specific scenario. Along with that, I want to increase the accessibility and user friendliness of the project. I also need to fix the hovering when the image is clicked on whether this be having the picture stay in the hovered state or adding a picture of my actual family members under. If there is time, I would also like to include more of my family members.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item3">
        <h2>design strategies</h2>
        <p>I think visually my project will look the same as the original in terms of the color scheme, type, and layout. However some small changes are playing with the spacing and positioning of the overlay and the text contained in the overall. I remember during feedback, there were a lot of comments stating that the text was too close to the figure and looked crowded, so I definitely want to be mindful of that in the final project. One idea I want to try is creating a popup overlay over the whole page rather than placing the overlay next to the figure.</p>
      </div>  
      <div class="item4">
        <h2>interaction strategies</h2>
        <p>As stated in the project goals, I want to focus a lot on the interaction aspect of the project. At the beginning of the carousel, I want to remove the previous button and at the end of the carousel I want to remove the next button. In addition, I want to create a version of a progress bar to show what position the carousel is, how many photos are left, and the length of the carousel. There’s also no feedback when the image is clicked besides the overlay but it doesn’t really indicate that the original image was clicked on. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <h2>experience goals</h2>
        <p>I want users to firstly take in the visual aspect in the idea that less is more. This deals with the colors and the content on the page. However, because there isn’t much on the page, I want the users to always know what to do next. That's why I want to make use of a lot of feedback using hovering and color changes and implement a lot of interaction indicators. Overall, I want the users to learn more about my family’s love language and the different foods and snacks I had growing up and maybe they would want to try them too!</p>
