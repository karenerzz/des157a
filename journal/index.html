                    <h2>FORM DESIGN</h2>
                    <date>January 31, 2023</date>
                    <p>While reading the article, I was surprised to see how much I didn’t know about form design. The article mentioned many things that I would’ve never thought about or considered so I’m glad I know now and can implement them in my future designs. The items that really caught my eye were the positioning of labels and placeholder text. It totally makes sense that design of inline text shouldn’t be recommended due to the fact that users won’t be able to see the label or placeholder text once they make an input unless they remove the input completely. This is something that I want to keep in mind because in my opinion, I personally think inline text looks visually better, but it is not user friendly.</p>

	                <p>For a website that has an enjoyable user experience for forms, I really enjoy <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/ ">airbnb’s</a> form design. The website highlights the input field and breaks the form up into different sections with a display of the form progression. Overall, it is very simple and easy to fill out.</p>
