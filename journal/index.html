                    <h2>VISUAL THINKING STRATEGIES</h2>
                    <date>February 9, 2023</date>
                    <p>As a college student, I will admit that I tend to move fast while going over texts or even certain images. It made me realize that maybe I should slow down and actually try to understand what is presented to me. I think just with the current generation it is so easy to just move fast past things. It’s practiced in social media every day with the quick moving pace of scrolling through TikTok or Instagram.</p>

                    <p>The tips listed were very interesting. I think it’s interesting that they write things from a student and teacher point of view, but it brings up the question of how to carry out these tips as an individual. It teaches a lesson of keeping yourself accountable to constantly and consistently challenge yourself mentally. Instead of having teachers ask you open-ended questions, you have to challenge yourself to continue being curious.</p>

                    <h2>OVERLAY DESIGNS</h2>
                    <date>February 7, 2023</date>
                    <p>I found that more recently I have been using overlays in a lot of my personal projects so this was a super insightful read on the design of overlays. Seeing that modals aren't encouraged in mobile design was actually very surprising to me and something I need to keep in mind because in the past I have used modals in mobile designs and maybe that is something I need to revisit now that it isn't ideal. It was also surprising because I feel like I see modals a lot in mobile applications.</p>

                    <p>I definitely want to see how I can use overlays and modals in my future designs and I'll try to remember all the tips listed in order to fit the design standards. Some that I think are especially important is a way to exit the overlay and the darkening of the background.</p>

                    <h2>FORM DESIGN</h2>
                    <date>January 31, 2023</date>
                    <p>While reading the article, I was surprised to see how much I didn’t know about form design. The article mentioned many things that I would’ve never thought about or considered so I’m glad I know now and can implement them in my future designs. The items that really caught my eye were the positioning of labels and placeholder text. It totally makes sense that design of inline text shouldn’t be recommended due to the fact that users won’t be able to see the label or placeholder text once they make an input unless they remove the input completely. This is something that I want to keep in mind because in my opinion, I personally think inline text looks visually better, but it is not user friendly.</p>

	                <p>For a website that has an enjoyable user experience for forms, I really enjoy <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/ ">airbnb’s</a> form design. The website highlights the input field and breaks the form up into different sections with a display of the form progression. Overall, it is very simple and easy to fill out.</p>
