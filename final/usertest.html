                    <li>
                        <h3>overlays</h3>
                        <p>The overlays didn’t reset when the slide was changed and that is one of the main points my testers brought up. However, I saw that a lot of my testers closed the overlay before moving onto the next slide.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>information button</h3>
                        <p>My testers hesitated to click on the information button or didn’t click on the button at all. So the information button definitely went unnoticed when I wanted it to be interacted with.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>slideshow dot indicator</h3>
                        <p>All my testers were interacting with the slideshow dot indicators so I thought that was interesting. Through questioning, I realized that changing a slide through its indicator is a very popular interaction.</p>
                        
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>improvements</h2>
                <p>Based on these insights and other feedback, I plan on resetting the overlays when the slides change and making the information button more in frame with the other content. Additionally, I plan on fixing design inconsistency issues such as the buttons.</p>
